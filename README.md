# My project


Requires pygame!
recomend "pip install pygame"
or if you don't have pip
go to http://www.pygame.org and find the instal
does not like textwrangler compilation
would not recomend pycharm as it is harder to import pygame
when I run in terminal the folder path requires "" around it for some reason
folder path expects a string like Username + "/folder/" where Username is the acount you are using
folder path treats "C:/Users/" + Username +"/folder/" the same as Username + "/folder" the same as Username + "/folder/Gunn-project-pygame-master/"
